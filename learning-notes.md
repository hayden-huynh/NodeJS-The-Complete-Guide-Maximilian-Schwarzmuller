# Getting Started

- NodeJS is a JavaScript Runtime i.e. the original V8 Engine in the Chrome brower is modified (added necessary system interection features like interacting with the filesystem and removed unnecessary brower-dedicated features like interacting with the DOM) so that it can compile JavaScript code to run outside of the browser environment and instead on any machines.

- NodeJS is not just for implementing server applications (although this is its most popular purpose of usage). It can also be used to create scripts and build tools that can run on many systems.

- NodeJS is both a Web Server (can listen to requests from clients and send back responses) and a backend application (handle Authentication, Databases, Validation and other business logics necessary). The backend language PHP cannot listen to incoming requests and send back responses but rather it requires a separate Web Server software like nginx or apache
